    <p>C (pronounced /ˈsiː/ – like the letter c) <sup>[6]</sup> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">general-purpose</a> computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by <mark>Dennis Ritchie</mark>, 
        and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use 
        in <mark>operating systems</mark>, <mark>device drivers</mark>, and protocol stacks, but its use in <mark>application</mark> software has been decreasing. <sup>[7]</sup> C is commonly used on computer 
        architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and <mark>embedded systems</mark> .</p>
    <p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. 
        It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. <sup>[8]</sup> During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most 
        widely used programming languages,<sup>[9][10]</sup> with C compilers available for almost <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a></sup> all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C 
        Programming Language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language. <sup>[11][12]</sup> C has been 
        standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p><br>

HTML Notes:

Using ! -> we can get the basic structure of html
<!DOCTYPE html> -> tells the version of html
We can add image in html using internet link -> copy address of pic[by right clicking on image] and paste path in src of img tag

<br /> -> break element [line break]

To make a text bold -> we use em, i.e., strong [only in ver 5]

CSS -> for styling for html
Html -> is just for structure
JavaScript -> operation

If a tag is not recommended, then that tag will be in red colour

div -> tag for a container; helps in grouping


Form creation using html
- label -> used for identification of text field
- i/p type = button -> doesn't enter data; it is only a button
- i/p type = submit -> enters data
- for in label -> to match label to that i/p
		when for, idr same then when we press the label the the checkbox will be selected. Without them then we need 		to manually press on the checkbox
- Name will help in identification in database 
- action -> place to store data submited. If action is empty then the data will go to the program, i.e.,_________.html -> default.
- Always give name and id when working with forms

CSS
Testing or experimenting can be done through inspect.Refreshing the site will undo the changes done in inspect. Permenant changes can only be done through code.

3 types of CSS:
- inline -> inside the tag of the needed element
- internal -> inside the head tag -> styling is done inside style tag-> inside style tag element type, such as h1, p, etc then {}
using internal, all elements having a tag will be styled
- external -> styling in another CSS file. To apply changes of CSS file to another html file, we need to link. In that we need to give path of CSS file in href. Internal and external css have same syntax

Organize html files in html folder, css file in css folder and javascript files in javascript folder
;
Range of headings is 1-6

For dtyling clsdd in CSS, syntax -> .<class>id is fenoted by #

Priority: id and class>tag

.into-section -> is a class

This is better than centre tag
p{
    text-align: center;
}

*{...} -> universal selector; styling is applied for all elements
	Most commonly used properties used in * is
		- Margin - used for space b/w elements; external	
		- Padding - used for space inside element nd b/w content ; internal
			    padding top - padding only on the top

It is not correct to put br for space b/w elements instead use padding and margin

- Colour cn be specified by rgb, name or hex

-Opacity ranges from 0 to 1

- Background image -> mention a URL -> link or location

While mentioning location -> ../ -> means go 1 directory back

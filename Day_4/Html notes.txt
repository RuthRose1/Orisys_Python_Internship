Web Scrapping

<html>......</html> - the full thing is called element
		      The <....> is known as tags
		      
style -> attribute or property of html

indentation not mandatory

website content goes in body; content can be anything: video, image,etc.

<h1>....</h1> -> heading 1 -> most imp heading
Heading variations -> from h1 to h6
Each headings have a meaning, the difference is not just its size
Anything can be in h1 element

<p>...</p> -> paragraph

List element:
- Unordered list(UL) -> bullets is dots, etc
- Ordered list (OL) -> bullets are numbers, etc
To display as a list -> list item is needed [list item -> <li>...</li>]

Metadescription -> a property of html

target -> attribute of html
	  target = "_blank" -> opens links in a new page

lorem picsum -> random pics
lorem -> random text

for image in website -> save image in the same folder as that of html code

for table -> we need to separately give the lines for it

Multiple elements can have the same class name but only 1 element can have 1 unique id. No 2 elements have the same id


Designing Rules:
- Never give dark font and dark background
- Never create art in web designing; art doesn't matter in designing; user experience matters in designing

CSS

3 types of CSS:
	inline -> inside the tag
	internal -> styling done inside style tab
	external -> styling done in another css file
		    [<link rel="stylesheet" href="">] <- For 		    linking

If we want to colour all headings in a colour, we can write
h1, h2, h3,..{element} -> using external

# -> id
. -> class

Using class:
in main prog:
< h1 class = 'Head'>......</h1>, ettc
in colour.css
.class name
{
	colour: red;
}

Using id
< h1 class = 'Head'>......</h1>, ettc
in colour.css =
#id_name
{
	colour: red;
}
